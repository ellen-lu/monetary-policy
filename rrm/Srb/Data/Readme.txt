The Riksbank (Swedish central bank) has had an independent status in rela-tion to the Riksdag and the Government since January 1999. 
This independent status is set out in Swedish law. Decisions regarding changes in interest rates are taken by an Executive Board 
consisting of six members who, according to the Riksbank Act (1988:1385), may not seek or take instructions on matters relating to monetary policy. 
According to the Instrument of Government, no public authority can determine how the Riksbank decides in matters relating to monetary policy.

Sweden started the transition to a new monetary regime in January 1993. Two months before (November 19, 1992) the fixed exchange rate regime 
had been abandoned and the krona –following a very costly but failed attempt to defend the parity – had been allowed to float. 
Soon thereafter (January 15, 1993) the Riksbank announced that monetary policy would be run based on an inflation targeting regime, 
and the first prototype Inflation Report was published in June of that year. The inflation target was set at 2 per cent and formally began to apply on 1 January 1995.

The Riksbank Act of 1999 greatly increased the independence of the central bank along several dimensions, in particular by creating an independent 
Executive Board with long-term appointments that are protected from severance from employment and that can neither “seek nor take instructions when 
fulfilling their monetary policy duties.”

The official inflation target is defined in terms of the consumer price index (CPI) which is substantially impacted by changes in the costs of housing.

In January 1993, shortly after Sweden abandoned the fixed exchange rate and let the krona float freely on the foreign exchange market, 
the General Council of the Riksbank decided that Sweden’s operative monetary policy would be based on an inflation target. The objective, 
which formally began to apply on 1 January 1995, was formulated as follows:
• Inflation was to be limited to 2 per cent per year, with a tolerance range of ± 1 per cent.
• The target was to be defined in terms of the consumer price index (CPI).
• The target was to be symmetrical, in the sense that the Riksbank would view excessively low inflation as seriously as it would excessively high inflation.
