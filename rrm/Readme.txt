These codes replicate the results in our paper "Monetary Policy by Committee: Consensus, Chairman Dominance or
Simple Majority?," published  in the Quarterly Journal of Economics, Vol. 125(1), 2010, pp. 363-416.

Each folder contains GAUSS codes, output and a subfolder with data for a particular central bank: BoC is the Bank of Canada,
BoE is the Bank of England, and so forth. Note that the paths in the codes need to be modified by the user.

These programs may be used or modified provided the original paper is cited.
